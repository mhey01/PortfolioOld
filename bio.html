    <div class="about">
        <p class="pBio">
                I graduated as a Master of Engineering from Queen's University Belfast on July 3rd 2019 with an Upper 2.1 Honours.
                Through my time at University, I found a deep passion for coding and I have decided to pursue a career following
                that interest. I was first drawn to Engineering as a discipline due its nature in combining creativity and logic
                to solve problems and create amazing things. Then I discovered coding. I had just found a tool with almost limitless potential
                to produce crazy and wonderful applications for almost anything. It's almost like being a wizard, but with a keyboard
                in place of a staff (I'm a bit of a nerd).
        </p>
        <p class="pBio">
                But, I was still an engineer. My degree included a placement year where I went away and worked as a full time engineer.
                And I really didn't like it. At all. I still kept my programming skills with me and used them wherever I could - I created a
                Python script that would scan complicated technical drawings to highlight symbols relating to components in the field that
                needed to be investigated - but it became clear to me that I wasn't meant to be an engineer. At least not in this sense
                of the word.
        </p>
        <p class="pBio">
                Nevertheless, I persisted and got the job done. When my placement came to an end, I decided that I would alter my career path.
                As a visual person, I love seeing code turn into beautiful and creative things on the screen, so I dove head-first into learning
                web development. I purchased a course on Udemy by Jonas Schmedtmann titled 'Build Responsive Real World Websites with HTML5 and
                CSS3'. I loved every moment, and when I finished it I wanted more.
        </p>
        <p class="pBio">
                But by this time, I was returning to University to complete my final year, and I knew I wouldn't have the time to get my
                hands dirty with web development for a while. I worked hard and specialised my degree with Computational Engineering modules
                and a Master's thesis involving programming and simulation. Besides the stress that comes with a student's final year at University,
                I loved my time at QUB and I am now working with them to hopefully publish two articles based on my thesis in academic journals.
        </p>
        <p class="pBio">
                I have now turned my focus solely to becoming programmer (or a keyboard wizard). Blessed with free time, I got myself back on Udemy with
                'The Complete JavaScript Course' by Jonas Schmedtmann and I am working my way through. I'm working on projects every day, and
                everything I make I am getting one step closer to my goal of becoming a developer.
        </p>
        <p class="pBio">
                Thanks for taking the time to read this. Have a great day.
        </p>
