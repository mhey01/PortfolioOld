            I wanted to begin a blog to document my progress in my journey to becoming
            a developer. So that's exactly what I'm going to do. I hope that it will help
            others in their own journey.
        </p>
        <p class="pBlogContent">
            So let's begin with who I am.
        </p>
        <p class="pBlogContent">
            My name is Matt and I was born in England. Growing up, I always wanted to make things.
            My father spent a lot of time in his workshop making furniture for the house
            out of wood and it fascinated me. He became a joiner after leaving school and had always
            been very skilled with his hands. One day I went in to the workshop with him and attempted
            woodworking myself, and I was awful at it. It frustrated me endlessly that I couldn't create things with
            wood, and I protested often that I would one day be able to do it. I never did.
        </p>
        <p class="pBlogContent">
            I wasn't blessed with a practical set of hands. I'm rather clumsy and despite my desire to
            make things and the numerous attempts to do so, I could never produce anything of quality.
            Plus, my lack of ability probably made me quite dangerous in a workshop...
        </p>
        <p class="pBlogContent">
            Instead, I turned to other outlets and started playing guitar. After learning to play
            guitar, some friends and I formed a band. We made our own songs and played at school
            events. I loved it. From there I learned to play the drums, joined a number of bands,
            played small gigs for friends in a town hall, and started acting.
        </p>
        <p class="pBlogContent">
            Then I started sixth-form, and it all ended. I grew up in a very remote part of England,
            and our sixth-forms were not joined to the high schools we went to. They were separate
            entities and very far away from each other. Adding in the difficulty spike from GCSE to
            A-Level, it didn't really feel like there was any time.
        </p>
        <p class="pBlogContent">
            I studied Maths, Physics and Biology at A-Level, and towards the end I had no idea what
            I wanted to do. Eventually I was turned towards Engineering by my teachers and became
            infatuated by the idea of fusing my desire for something creative and the logic of
            Maths and Physics.
        </p>
        <p class="pBlogContent">
            I was accepted into my first choice university - Queen's University Belfast - to study
            Mechanical Engineering and I was incredibly excited. Moving away from the remote 
            depths of England to what was practically a whole new world to me was amazing.
        </p>
        <p class="pBlogContent">
            It was here that I discovered programming. I'd found another way to create things,
            but without my clumsy hands (except for typing on a keyboard). Even better, the possibilities
            with programming seem quite literally endless, and this began my passion for coding.
        </p>
        <p class="pBlogContent">
            I have since graduated from Queen's University Belfast with a Master's degree in Mechanical
            Engineering. That was 8 days ago from writing this blog post. I'm incredibly proud of my
            achievement, but being a 'Mechanical Engineer' doesn't suit me. I want to program. I want to
            create beautiful and useful applications. So I'm learning everything I can to start a career
            as a Front-End Developer.
        </p>
        <p class="pBlogContent">
            I started with HTML and CSS, and have moved on to JavaScript (the scary one), and I'm
            enjoying every moment of it. I'm that weird guy who really enjoys getting lost in learning
            things. It's going well so far and I've started to build up a <a class="shameless" href="https://mhey01.github.io/Portfolio">portfolio</a>
            of all the things I'm creating. I also have a <a class="shameless" href="https://codepen.io/mhey01/#">CodePen</a>
            where I create illustrations using only HTML, CSS and JS.
        </p>
        <p class="pBlogContent">
            Now I am also building this blog to document my progress and post what I have learned.
            Coding is hard but there are many resources out there that you can use to really propel
            yourself into, even if you don't want to spend any money. Just hit YouTube and search for what you want
            to learn, it'll be there. I have been told the greatest skill to learn in programming
            is how to find the solutions online, and it seems to ring true. We can't remember every
            intricate detail. We're only human afterall. StackOverflow will become your best friend.
        </p>    
        <p class="pBlogContent">
            I hope that once I've written a few articles in this blog, someone finds some use
            in it. I'd love to be able to help others along their way to becoming a developer.
            To the people reading this in the future: if you ever find something useful here,
            drop me a message on Instagram and say hello. It'd be great to hear from you.
        </p>   
        <p class="pBlogContent">
            So that's my first blog post. Ever. I have no idea what I'm doing, but let's see where this
            goes.
